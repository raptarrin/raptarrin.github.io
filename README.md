===================

A map page that, when clicked, brings up a satellite image chip from tomnod. I set the view for Shenyang, China because it is a place I visited in 2005. 

This uses Leafletjs, a mapping library, OpenStreetMap tiles, and a topographical overlay from Thunderforest. 

Future additions might include a search capability and an overlay showing night/day. 

This can be viewed live at http://raptarrin.github.io
